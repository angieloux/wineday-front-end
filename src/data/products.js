A shimmering, vivid, youthful vitality elevates the fruit flavors, with juicy acidity and restrained oak influence. Though this is the least expensive wine in the Archery Summit portfolio, it may surprise those who cellar it. Some extra years in the bottle could bring out unsuspected depth and power.',
